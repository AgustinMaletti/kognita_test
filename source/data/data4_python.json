The issue is that I can't understand how it works. I understand that it creates 10 widgets as defined in the  class but I've been trying for 2 days to implement it in my code yet it seems I can't return it. I only manage to one instance of the  and when I try to scroll nothing happens when it should be changing slides. I can't post my code because it consists of multiple files. I want an example if possible that has the following structure in KV.\n<MainLayout>\n RecycleView:\n  BoxLayout:\n   *insert carousel here*\nI made it work using directly the following kv code\nCarousel:\ndirection: 'right'\nAsyncImage:\n    source: 'http://placehold.it/480x270.png&text=slide-1.png'\nAsyncImage:\n    source: 'http://placehold.it/480x270.png&text=slide-2.png'\nand it works but I can't manually write all of the sources everytime... Hence the need for the python code to do it with a for loop. Could someone provide me with an example that returns a MainLayout that is a screen or whatever, and not the carousel itself? I want the carousel to be created in python and then called in kivy. I feel like the solution is pretty simple but I can't wrap my head around it for some reason.",

Now that I have calculated the performance for each BIB#, I want to allocate them into two different groups based on their performance. I have therefore written the following code:\ndf1 = df1.sort_values(by='PRESTASJON', ascending=True)\n, which sort values in the DataFrame. Now I want to iterate through df1['prestasjon'] and for each i, I want to assign the person (i.e. BIB#) to either group A or Group B. How can I do this?\nI have no idea what I am looking for. I have looked up in the documentation for the random module in Python but that is not exactly what I am looking for. I have seen some questions/posts pointing to a scikit-learn stratification function but I don't know if that is a good choice. Alternatively, is there a way to create a loop that accomplishes this? I appreciate your help.\nEDIT!\nI have added a figure to illustrate what I want to accomplish",

First matrix will contain first 4 rates of Rate1, Rate2, Rate3, Rate4 and Rate5: like this\n16 6 5 6 0   0 5 2 0 0   16 8 8 9 10   0 7 6 6 6\n16 6 4 5 0   0 5 0 0 0   16 7 8 9 9    0 7 6 6 6\n16 6 3 2 0   0 5 0 0 0   0  7 8 9 8    0 6 6 5 6\n0  5 2 0 0   0 5 0 0 0   0  7 8 7 7    0 6 5 5 2\nAfter sorting all these matrices, the expected output will look like this:\nfrom 1st matrix: \n[16,16,16,6] = rates\n[7,2,10,26] = Dev\n\nfrom 2nd matrix: \n[5,5,5,5] = rates\n[17,8,14,26] = dev\n\nfrom 3rd matrix: \n[16,16,10,9] = rates\n[12,7,90,49] = dev\n\nfrom 4th matrix: \n[7,7,6,6] = rates\n[53,30,48,37] = dev\n\ncombined result:\n[16,16,16,6,5,5,5,5,16,16,10,9,7,7,6,5] = rates\n[7,2,10,26,12,7,90,49,53,30,48,37,53,30,48,37] = dev\nMy attempt:\nimport itertools\nfrom itertools import chain\nprice1 = list(zip(Rate1, deviation))\nprice2 = list(zip(Rate2, deviation))\nprice3 = list(zip(Rate3, deviation))\nprice4 = list(zip(Rate4, deviation))\nprice5 = list(zip(Rate5, deviation))\n\nnewPrice1 = [sorted(block, reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])[:4] for block in price1]\nnewPrice2 = [sorted(block, reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])[:4] for block in price2]\nnewPrice3 = [sorted(block, reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])[:4] for block in price3]\nnewPrice4 = [sorted(block, reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])[:4] for block in price4]\nnewPrice5 = [sorted(block, reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])[:4] for block in price5]\n\nrate1, dev = map(list, zip(*chain.from_iterable(newPrice1)))\nrate2, dev = map(list, zip(*chain.from_iterable(newPrice2)))\nrate3, dev = map(list, zip(*chain.from_iterable(newPrice3)))\nrate4, dev = map(list, zip(*chain.from_iterable(newPrice4)))\nrate5, dev = map(list, zip(*chain.from_iterable(newPrice5)))\nI don't know the right approach. Can someone please help?",

I want to create a relationship between the User and the SeriesText, so I can grab the current logged user in the VIEW, and just return all of his subscriptions at the dashboard template.\nAn user would be able to subscribe to as many series as he wants.\nI’m using the default User model from django.contrib.auth.models, and I’m not sure how to create this relationship.\nI read a lot and I think the correct usage here would be Many-to-many (is that correct?), so I tried this, using a pivot table/model called Subscriptions:\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User as BaseUserClass\n\nclass User(BaseUserClass):\n    subscriptions = models.ManyToManyField(SeriesText, through=\"Subscription\")\n\n\n class SeriesText(models.Model):\n    series_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    series_text = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    subbed_users = models.ManyToManyField(User, through=\"Subscription\")\n\n\nclass Subscription(models.Model):\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    series = models.ForeignKey(SeriesText, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\n    def subscribe(self, user_id, series_id):\n        self.user = user_id\n        self.series = series_id\n        self.save()\nBut that didn’t seem to work, I got errors even trying to use a User.objects.get(pk=1), don’t really know why.\nI’m really confused if I need to put the relationship both ways, like created models.ManyToMany on SeriesText model, and on an extended User model (that I don’t even know if that’s really the way to do it). I'm not even sure if that the correct way to make a relationship using the default auth user model.\nTo be able to later also search for all users subscribed to a series, I think that the models.ManyToMany should also be on the SeriesText model, is that also correct?\nCan someone help me understand if I’m using the correct relationship (many-to-many), and how to make this relationship?

For example, I can have two columns named:\nReturn.ReturnData.IRS990.EOYAmount and Return.ReturnData.IRS990PF.EOYAmount as you can see the only difference is at IRS990/IRS990PF. But these two columns contain similar data so I want tor rename them both to EOYAmount.\nObviously I have a couple thousand files so I can't do this for every single one but I wanted to know how to truncate everything before the last period?

I need to achieve >= 25 FPS and that is why we used YOLOv3 as its one of fastest object detectors (using gpu though) in the market.\nSince the FPS actually improved and log doesn't show any error on building OpenCV or compiling the code we are not quite sure what is the problem, tesla p40 should be enough to get higher FPS.\nPERFORMANCE\nI've seen other techniques as threading or multiprocessing but I'm not sure how this will work if I'm using CUDA cores and CPU cores. I did normal coding with opencv, numpy and others ut I wonder if the performance would improve using a Yolo-tensorflow-implementation.\nThe main question is: ¿How the hell can I reach the desire FPS, any ideas?",

If not, then what is the difference between these authentication options?\nEdit:\nIt seems the documentation answers part of this question further down:\n\nA service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs [sic].\nSince it’s a separate account, by default it does not have access to any spreadsheet until you share it with this account. Just like any other Google account.\n\nThe second part to my question still remains-- why would I use the bot option, and what is the difference, provided I am only accessing sheets from one Google user?",

But it doesn't work.\nThis is what i did...\nAny suggestion?\nThanks\nghi = np.reshape(GHI_1year, (365 * 24, 140, 100))\n\nlon_hour = np.zeros((24 * 365, 140, 100))\n\nfor nlo in range(0, 140, 1):\n    lon_cal = np.zeros((60 * 24 * 365, 100))\n    lon_int = interp1d(nlo, ghi[:, nlo, :], axis=1)\n    lon_int = lon_int[nlo + 181, :]\n    len1 = lon_int.shape\n    lon_cal[nlo + 181:len1, :] = lon_int\n    lon_cal_h = np.mean(np.reshape(lon_cal, (60, 24, 365), order='C'), axis=0)\n    lon_hour[:, nlo, :] = lon_cal_h",

Example:\n\nvar long_string = 'some text not important. just garbage to' +\n                  'illustrate my example';\n\nI tried doing something similar in Python, but it didn't work, so I used \\ to split the long string.

Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation \n        ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo.'''.split())\n\nOutput:\n\n'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo.'\n\nWith regard to OP's question relating to a SQL query, the answer below disregards the correctness of this approach to building SQL queries and focuses only on building long strings in a readable and aesthetic way without additional imports. It also disregards the computational load this entails.\n\nUsing triple quotes we build a long and readable string which we then break up into a list using split() thereby stripping the whitespace and then join it back together with ' '.join(). Finally we insert the variables using the format() command:\n\naccount_id = 123\ndef_id = 321\n\n_str = '''\n    SELECT action.descr AS \"action\", role.id AS role_id, role.descr AS role \n    FROM public.role_action_def, public.role, public.record_def, public.action\n    WHERE role.id = role_action_def.role_id \n    AND record_def.id = role_action_def.def_id \n    AND' action.id = role_action_def.action_id \n    AND role_action_def.account_id = {} \n    AND record_def.account_id = {} \n    AND def_id = {}\n    '''\n\nquery = ' '.join(_str.split()).format(account_id, account_id, def_id)\n\n\nProduces:\n\nSELECT action.descr AS \"action\", role.id AS role_id, role.descr AS role FROM public.role_action_def, public.role, public.record_def, public.action WHERE role.id = role_action_def.role_id AND record_def.id = role_action_def.def_id AND\\' action.id = role_action_def.action_id AND role_action_def.account_id = 123 AND record_def.account_id=123 AND def_id=321\n\nEdit: This approach is not in line with PEP8 but I find it useful at times",

            "question_text": "I have put together a keras regresssion model to predict the change in angle of a single particle when supplied with data about that particle. To aquire the data, I created a program that models brownian motion between n particles. As well as random angular noise, depending on how close together the particles are they will induce a change in each others angle.\nIt is not too important how my code works, but essentially it outputs an array containing the x,y coordinates of all particles relative to the single particle, the value of theta of all particles, and the distance between all particles and the single particle. All of these parameters are found at each time step. Each 'image' I use to train the network is all these parameters at some point in time. So overall, the input variable is x,y,angle,distance, and the output variable is the change in theta of the target particle\nFor my neural network I first normalised all my data to be between -1 and 1, and then reshaped it to be fed into the NN:\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nfrom keras.layers import Dropout\n\n## NORMALIZE IMAGES ##########################################################\n\n# all images and labels imported, so obviously wont run without data. This is\n# designed for running data with m iterations, n particles, 4 parameters\n# (size of test data array is [m,n,4]). \n\nL = 5\n# length of 'box' that houses particles\nn = 10\n# number of particles\n\ntrain_images[:,:,0:2] = train_images[:,:,0:2]/L\n# normalise [x,y] from -L:L to -1:1.\ntrain_images[:,:,2:3] = train_images[:,:,2:3]/(2*np.pi)\n# normalise theta value from -2pi:2pi to -1:1\ntrain_images[:,:,3:4] = (train_images[:,:,3:4]/(L*np.sqrt(2))*2)-1\n# normalise distance value from 0:sqrt(2)L to -1:1\n\ntest_images[:,:,0:2] = test_images[:,:,0:2]/L\ntest_images[:,:,2:3] = test_images[:,:,2:3]/(2*np.pi)\ntest_images[:,:,3:4] = (test_images[:,:,3:4]/(L*np.sqrt(2))*2)-1\n\n## FLATTEN IMAGES ############################################################\n\ntrain_images = train_images.reshape((-1, 4*(n-1))) \n# reshape so each input is a single dimension\n# 4*(n-1) due to 4 parameters, adn n-1 particles (since one is redundant info)\ntest_images = test_images.reshape((-1, 4*(n-1)))\n\n## BUILDING THE MODEL ########################################################\n\nmodel = Sequential([\n  Dense(64, activation='tanh', input_shape=(4*(n-1),)),\n  Dense(16, activation='tanh'),\n  Dropout(0.25),\n  Dense(1, activation='tanh'),\n])\n\n## COMPILING THE MODEL #######################################################\n\nmodel.compile(\n  optimizer='adam',\n  loss='mean_squared_error',\n  #metrics=['mean_squared_error'],\n)\n\n## TRAINING THE MODEL ########################################################\n\nhistory = model.fit(\n  train_images, # training data\n  train_labels, # training targets\n  epochs=10,\n  batch_size=32,\n  #validation_data=(test_images, test_labels),\n  shuffle=True,\n  validation_split=0.2,\n)\nI have used a variety of activation types for the different layers (relu, sigmoid, tanh...), but none seem to give me the correct results. The true values of my data (the change in angle of the particle) are values ranging from about 0.02 to -0.02, but the values I am getting are much smaller, and tend to be predominantly one sign (pos/neg).\nI am currently using the loss function 'mean absolute error', as I am looking to minimise the difference between the real and predicted value. I notice when doing this, that after only one epoch the loss is already incredibly tiny:\nEpoch 1/10\n12495/12495 [==============================] - 13s 1ms/step - loss: 0.0010 - val_loss: 3.3794e-05\nEpoch 2/10\n12495/12495 [==============================] - 13s 1ms/step - loss: 3.4491e-05 - val_loss: 3.3769e-05\nEpoch 3/10\n12495/12495 [==============================] - 13s 1ms/step - loss: 3.4391e-05 - val_loss: 3.3883e-05\nEpoch 4/10\n12495/12495 [==============================] - 13s 1ms/step - loss: 3.4251e-05 - val_loss: 3.4755e-05\nEpoch 5/10\n12495/12495 [==============================] - 13s 1ms/step - loss: 3.4183e-05 - val_loss: 3.4273e-05\nEpoch 6/10\n12495/12495 [==============================] - 13s 1ms/step - loss: 3.4175e-05 - val_loss: 3.3770e-05\nEpoch 7/10\n12495/12495 [==============================] - 13s 1ms/step - loss: 3.4160e-05 - val_loss: 3.3646e-05\nEpoch 8/10\n12495/12495 [==============================] - 13s 1ms/step - loss: 3.4131e-05 - val_loss: 3.3629e-05\nEpoch 9/10\n12495/12495 [==============================] - 14s 1ms/step - loss: 3.4145e-05 - val_loss: 3.3581e-05\nEpoch 10/10\n12495/12495 [==============================] - 13s 1ms/step - loss: 3.4148e-05 - val_loss: 3.4647e-05\nHere is an example of the results I get from this:\nPrediction:  4.8542774e-05\nActual:  0.006994473448353978\nIs there anything obviously wrong I have done to get these results?

When you then modify this single x it is visible via all three references to it:\n\nx = [1] * 4\nl = [x] * 3\nprint(f\"id(x): {id(x)}\")\n# id(x): 140560897920048\nprint(\n    f\"id(l[0]): {id(l[0])}\\n\"\n    f\"id(l[1]): {id(l[1])}\\n\"\n    f\"id(l[2]): {id(l[2])}\"\n)\n# id(l[0]): 140560897920048\n# id(l[1]): 140560897920048\n# id(l[2]): 140560897920048\n\nx[0] = 42\nprint(f\"x: {x}\")\n# x: [42, 1, 1, 1]\nprint(f\"l: {l}\")\n# l: [[42, 1, 1, 1], [42, 1, 1, 1], [42, 1, 1, 1]]\n\nTo fix it, you need to make sure that you create a new list at each position. One way to do it is\n\n[[1]*4 for _ in range(3)]\n\nwhich will reevaluate [1]*4 each time instead of evaluating it once and making 3 references to 1 list.\n\n\n\nYou might wonder why * can't make independent objects the way the list comprehension does. That's because the multiplication operator * operates on objects, without seeing expressions. When you use * to multiply [[1] * 4] by 3, * only sees the 1-element list [[1] * 4] evaluates to, not the [[1] * 4 expression text. * has no idea how to make copies of that element, no idea how to reevaluate [[1] * 4], and no idea you even want copies, and in general, there might not even be a way to copy the element.\n\nThe only option * has is to make new references to the existing sublist instead of trying to make new sublists. Anything else would be inconsistent or require major redesigning of fundamental language design decisions.\n\nIn contrast, a list comprehension reevaluates the element expression on every iteration. [[1] * 4 for n in range(3)] reevaluates [1] * 4 every time for the same reason [x**2 for x in range(3)] reevaluates x**2 every time. Every evaluation of [1] * 4 generates a new list, so the list comprehension does what you wanted.\n\nIncidentally, [1] * 4 also doesn't copy the elements of [1], but that doesn't matter, since integers are immutable. You can't do something like 1.value = 2 and turn a 1 into a 2.",

What the code does is basically print the ids of the obtained objects, which\n\n\n  Return the “identity” of an object\n\n\nand will help us identify them and analyse what happens:\n\nprint(\"myList:\")\nfor i, subList in enumerate(myList):\n    print(\"\\t[{}]: {}\".format(i, id(subList)))\n    for j, elem in enumerate(subList):\n        print(\"\\t\\t[{}]: {}\".format(j, id(elem)))\n\nAnd you will get the following output:\n\nx: 1\ny: [1]\nz: [1, 1, 1, 1]\nmyList:\n    [0]: 4300763792\n        [0]: 4298171528\n        [1]: 4298171528\n        [2]: 4298171528\n        [3]: 4298171528\n    [1]: 4300763792\n        [0]: 4298171528\n        [1]: 4298171528\n        [2]: 4298171528\n        [3]: 4298171528\n    [2]: 4300763792\n        [0]: 4298171528\n        [1]: 4298171528\n        [2]: 4298171528\n        [3]: 4298171528\n\n\n\nSo now let us go step-by-step. You have x which is 1, and a single element list y containing x. Your first step is y * 4 which will get you a new list z, which is basically [x, x, x, x], i.e. it creates a new list which will have 4 elements, which are references to the initial x object. The net step is pretty similar. You basically do z * 3, which is [[x, x, x, x]] * 3 and returns [[x, x, x, x], [x, x, x, x], [x, x, x, x]], for the same reason as for the first step.",

But since all the top-level list indexes are pointing at the same list, all the rows will look the same. And you will get the feeling that updating an element is updating all the elements in that column.\n\nCredits: Thanks to Pranav Devarakonda for the easy explanation here",

It removes names.\nFor example, say you have\n>>> x = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> y = x\n>>> z = x\nAll three names, x, y, z refer to the same list object. Now delete x:\n>>> del x\n>>> x\nNameError: name 'x' is not defined\nIt would make no sense for y and z to raise a NameError after this. Imagine especially if y and z were references in a different function or module. Having del x make other references disappear would lead to some very unexpected and undesirable behaviors.\nSo under normal circumstances, you can't quite do what you want to do. Your current method is just removing the name self in the local namespace of the method itself. It can not easily modify the global namespace.\nThat being said, you can write a function that removes a name from the global namespace. For example:\nclass MyClass:\n    def myFunc(self, name):\n        del globals()[name]\n\nmyInst = MyClass()\nmyInst.myFunc('myInst')\nNow, if you attempt to access myInst, the name will be gone in the script. This is a bad idea, and likely won't delete the object at all anyway. If you had another reference to myInst, e.g. in a list, dict or direct assignment to another name, that reference would persist, and so would the object itself.\nA much better approach, as suggested in the comments, is to mark the instance as unusable. For example, you can do something like\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.useable = True\n\n    def my_func(self):\n        self._check_useable()\n\n        # do your thing...\n\n        self.useable = False\n\n    def other_func(self, *args):\n        self._check_useable()\n        # Do stuff to args ...\n\n    def _check_useable(self):\n        if not self.useable:\n            raise ValueError('Class is not useable!')\nThere are more robust ways of implementing the flag to make it less accessible to the casual user, but they basically follow the same pattern.",

For example, i expect to get around 500 item_scraped_count but I only get back something like 325 items, or even when expecting to crawl a number as small as 25 items, it scrapes only like 20.\nI tried a few things, like:\nCONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 1\nRETRY_HTTP_CODES = [500, 502, 503, 504, 522, 524, 408, 429, 400, 404]\n# default is [500, 502, 503, 504, 522, 524, 408, 429]\nDOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT = 250 # default is 180\nIt helped but not much, it resulted in 337 item_scraped_count out of 500.\nThis is my DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES:\nDOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {\n    'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.useragent.UserAgentMiddleware': None,\n    'scrapy_user_agents.middlewares.RandomUserAgentMiddleware': 400,\n}\nI am using scrapy-user-agents to pick a different user agent for every request (I tried removing it, it didn't make any difference)\nAlso:\nCOOKIES_ENABLED = False\nDOWNLOAD_DELAY = 0.2\nI tried enabling cookies, no difference. Used cookiejar, no difference.\nFor the delay, I tried higher values like 0.5, but there was no difference also.\nHere's the stats of the job:\n{'downloader/request_bytes': 665823,\n 'downloader/request_count': 1712,\n 'downloader/request_method_count/GET': 1712,\n 'downloader/response_bytes': 49175801,\n 'downloader/response_count': 1712,\n 'downloader/response_status_count/200': 1701,\n 'downloader/response_status_count/404': 11,\n 'elapsed_time_seconds': 889.642693,\n 'finish_reason': 'finished',\n 'finish_time': datetime.datetime(2020, 8, 6, 12, 31, 23, 317411),\n 'httperror/response_ignored_count': 1,\n 'httperror/response_ignored_status_count/404': 1,\n 'item_scraped_count': 337,\n 'log_count/DEBUG': 3761,\n 'log_count/ERROR': 1,\n 'log_count/INFO': 26,\n 'log_count/WARNING': 45,\n 'memusage/max': 103399424,\n 'memusage/startup': 56680448,\n 'request_depth_max': 38,\n 'response_received_count': 1702,\n 'retry/count': 10,\n 'retry/max_reached': 1,\n 'retry/reason_count/404 Not Found': 10,\n 'scheduler/dequeued': 1712,\n 'scheduler/dequeued/memory': 1712,\n 'scheduler/enqueued': 1712,\n 'scheduler/enqueued/memory': 1712,\n 'start_time': datetime.datetime(2020, 8, 6, 12, 16, 33, 674718)}\nI looked into the logs output by the spider, and I noticed that some urls were crawled but never scraped (never exported as an item), and it looked like this:\n[scrapy.core.engine] DEBUG: Crawled (200) <GET https://url> (referer: https://parent_url)\n[scrapy_user_agents.middlewares] DEBUG: Assigned User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36\nMoreover, some of the urls were never even crawled (weren't present in the log file), although I tested the code in Scrapy shell and it was working properly (grabbed all urls).\nWhy is item_scraped_count less than it should be? Is Scrapy ignoring requests or it's due to Scrapy asynchronousity or something like that?\nAny ideas on what to try or what could be the problem would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks.",

Call DataFrame.groupby rather than Series.groupby. This results in simpler syntax.\n\n\n# The setup.\ndf[['Date', 'Data3']]\n\n         Date  Data3\n0  2015-05-08      5\n1  2015-05-07      8\n2  2015-05-06      6\n3  2015-05-05      1\n4  2015-05-08     50\n5  2015-05-07    100\n6  2015-05-06     60\n7  2015-05-05    120\n\n\n\ndf.groupby('Date')['Data3'].transform('sum')\n\n0     55\n1    108\n2     66\n3    121\n4     55\n5    108\n6     66\n7    121\nName: Data3, dtype: int64 \n\nIt's a tad faster,\n\ndf2 = pd.concat([df] * 12345)\n\n%timeit df2['Data3'].groupby(df['Date']).transform('sum')\n%timeit df2.groupby('Date')['Data3'].transform('sum')\n\n10.4 ms ± 367 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\n8.58 ms ± 559 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\n\n\n\nUnconventional, but Worth your Consideration: GroupBy.sum() + Series.map()\n\nI stumbled upon an interesting idiosyncrasy in the API. From what I tell, you can reproduce this on any major version over 0.20 (I tested this on 0.23 and 0.24). It seems like you consistently can shave off a few milliseconds of the time taken by transform if you instead use a direct function of GroupBy and broadcast it using map:\n\ndf.Date.map(df.groupby('Date')['Data3'].sum())\n\n0     55\n1    108\n2     66\n3    121\n4     55\n5    108\n6     66\n7    121\nName: Date, dtype: int64\n\nCompare with \n\ndf.groupby('Date')['Data3'].transform('sum')\n\n0     55\n1    108\n2     66\n3    121\n4     55\n5    108\n6     66\n7    121\nName: Data3, dtype: int64\n\nMy tests show that map is a bit faster if you can afford to use the direct GroupBy function (such as mean, min, max, first, etc). It is more or less faster for most general situations upto around ~200 thousand records. After that, the performance really depends on the data.  \n\n \n\n(Left: v0.23, Right: v0.24)\n\nNice alternative to know, and better if you have smaller frames with smaller numbers of groups. . . but I would recommend transform as a first choice. Thought this was worth sharing anyway.\n\nBenchmarking code, for reference:\n\nimport perfplot\n\nperfplot.show(\n    setup=lambda n: pd.DataFrame({'A': np.random.choice(n//10, n), 'B': np.ones(n)}),\n    kernels=[\n        lambda df: df.groupby('A')['B'].transform('sum'),\n        lambda df:  df.A.map(df.groupby('A')['B'].sum()),\n    ],\n    labels=['GroupBy.transform', 'GroupBy.sum + map'],\n    n_range=[2**k for k in range(5, 20)],\n    xlabel='N',\n    logy=True,\n    logx=True\n)",

The arguments are passed in the same order as they are defined in the __init__ method, therefore you have \"Andrei\" in the jugador argument and 27 in the fecha argument.

However, you did define the default value, so it gives the argument its default value.\nNow, since you don't use the fecha argument, you don't actually need it and the definition of your __init__ method can look like this:\n    def __init__(self, jugador, puntos = 0):\n            self.jugador = jugador\n            self.fecha = datetime.now()\n            self.puntos = puntos\nWhen you instantiate the object now and call your method imprimir(), it should give you the result you expect.\nNote, that if you want to print your object, you can use the inherited method __str__ of the Object class. You can do it like this:\n    def __str__(self):\n        return str(self.fecha) + \" \" + self.jugador + \" \" + str(self.puntos)\nAnd then you can just use print(resultado) to get the same result.\nAlso, as of Python 3.6, you can use f-strings, that are easier to work with, so you can write your output as:\n        return f\"{self.fecha} {self.jugador} {self.puntos}\"",

            "question_text": "Problem\nI am trying to write a custom loss function for my Tensorflow 2 model. I have written the following function that calculates the loss I am seeking when I manually pass in an input and output Tensor.\ndef on_off_balance_loss(y_true: EagerTensor, y_pred: EagerTensor) -> float:\n    y_true_array: ndarray = np.asarray(y_true).flatten()\n    y_predict_array: ndarray = np.asarray(y_pred).flatten()\n\n    on_delta: float = 0.999\n\n    on_loss: float = 0\n    off_loss: float = 0\n    on_count: int = 0\n    off_count: int = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(y_true_array)):\n        loss: float = cell_loss(y_true_array[i], y_predict_array[i])\n        if y_true_array[i] > on_delta:\n            on_count += 1\n            on_loss = on_loss * ((on_count - 1) / on_count) + (loss / on_count)\n        else:\n            off_count += 1\n            off_loss = off_loss * ((off_count - 1) / off_count) + (loss / off_count)\n\n    on_factor: int = 4\n    return (on_factor * on_loss + off_loss) / (on_factor + 1)\nFor context, y_true consists of a 2D matrix of 1's and 0's as floats, where 0's are much more common. As such, my model was getting a good loss value by just getting most of the 0's correct, even though where the 1's are is the more important metric. This custom loss puts more proportional emphasis on the location of the 1's.\nI changed model.compile(loss=\"binary_crossentropy\") to model.compile(loss=on_off_balance_loss) in the attempt to use the new loss function. This doesn't seem to work, as the loss function is supposed to take in an entire batch of data. So, I tried something like this with model.compile(loss=on_off_balance_batch_loss):\ndef on_off_balance_batch_loss(y_true, y_pred) -> float:\n    y_trues: list = tf.unstack(y_true)\n    y_preds: list = tf.unstack(y_pred)\n    loss: float = 0\n\n    for i in range(0, len(y_trues)):\n        loss = loss * (i / (i + 1)) + (on_off_balance_loss(y_trues[i], y_preds[i]) / (i + 1))\n\n    return loss\nThis doesn't work. The shape of y_true is (None, None, None), and the shape of y_pred is (None, X, Y), where X and Y are the dimensions of the 2D array of 1's and 0's.\nI am working in Google Colaboratory. However, locally, np.asarray() seems to work in the way that throws an error on Colaboratory. So, I'm not really sure if the error lies in my loss function or with some setup thing in Colaboratory. I have ensured that I am using Tensorflow 2.3.0 both locally and on Colaboratory.\nEDITS:\nI tried adding run_eagerly=True to model.compile() and using .numpy() instead of np.asarray() in on_off_balance_loss(). This changed the type of input in on_off_balance_batch_loss from Tensor to EagerTensor. This leads to the error ValueError: No gradients provided for any variable: ['lstm_3/lstm_cell_3/kernel:0', 'lstm_3/lstm_cell_3/recurrent_kernel:0', 'lstm_3/lstm_cell_3/bias:0', 'dense_2/kernel:0', 'dense_2/bias:0', 'lstm_4/lstm_cell_4/kernel:0', 'lstm_4/lstm_cell_4/recurrent_kernel:0', 'lstm_4/lstm_cell_4/bias:0', 'dense_3/kernel:0', 'dense_3/bias:0', 'lstm_5/lstm_cell_5/kernel:0', 'lstm_5/lstm_cell_5/recurrent_kernel:0', 'lstm_5/lstm_cell_5/bias:0']..",

Users will insert the ID and would like to get a report, so they don't need to see intermediate steps.
