It is designed to be quick to learn, understand, and use, and enforce a clean and uniform syntax. Please note that Python 2 is officially out of support as of 01-01-2020. Still, for version-specific Python questions, add the [python-2.7] or [python-3.x] tag. When using a Python variant or library (e.g. Jython, PyPy, Pandas, Numpy), please include it in the tags."
